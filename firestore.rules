/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StudyTrack Journal application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their profile and associated activities and problems.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is structured under the `/users/{userId}` path, with subcollections for activities and problems.
 * /users/{userId} - User profile information
 * /users/{userId}/activities/{activityId} - Activities for each user
 * /users/{userId}/problems/{problemId} - Problems solved by each user
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - No listing of all users is allowed.
 * - Data access is controlled through path-based rules.
