/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StudyTrack Journal application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their profile and associated journal entries, activities, and problems solved.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is structured under the `/users/{userId}` path, with subcollections for journal entries, activities, and problems solved.
 * /users/{userId} - User profile information
 * /users/{userId}/journalEntries/{journalEntryId} - Journal entries for each user
 * /users/{userId}/journalEntries/{journalEntryId}/activities/{activityId} - Activities associated with a journal entry
 * /users/{userId}/journalEntries/{journalEntryId}/problemsSolved/{problemSolvedId} - Problems solved associated with a journal entry
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - No listing of all users is allowed.
 * - Data access is controlled through path-based rules.
 * - The rules do not enforce strict data validation during this prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The Firestore structure already supports path-based ownership, so no additional denormalization is required.
