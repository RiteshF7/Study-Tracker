/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StudyTrack Journal.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user can only
 * access their own data. All data is nested under the /users/{userId} path,
 * ensuring complete isolation between users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user can read
 *   and write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/activities/{activityId}: Stores activities logged by the
 *   user. Only the user can read and write their own activities.
 * - /users/{userId}/problems/{problemId}: Stores problems solved by the user.
 *   Only the user can read and write their own problems.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All data is private to the user and no data is shared between users.
 * - Write operations require authentication and ownership validation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Not required, because the path-based ownership model is already adequate.
