/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StudyTrack Journal.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only
 * access their own profile information, activities, and solved problems.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that all documents and
 * subcollections are owned by the authenticated user.
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 *  - /users/{userId}/activities/{activityId}: Stores user activity logs.
 *  - /users/{userId}/problems/{problemId}: Stores user problem-solving data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - User data is private and only accessible by the owning user.
 *  - Listing other users is disallowed.
 *  - Self-creation is allowed for the /users/{userId} document.
 *  - No public data or shared resources are currently supported.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The 'userId' field in the 'Activity' and 'Problem' entities is used to
 *    enforce ownership and MUST match the '{userId}' path parameter.
