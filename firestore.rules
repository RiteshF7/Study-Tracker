/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StudyTrack Journal application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where users can only
 * access their own data, based on their unique user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-related data is nested under the /users/{userId} path. This includes
 * user profiles, activity logs, and solved problems.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.
 * - No user listing is allowed to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow rapid prototyping and iteration, but
 *   authorization checks are strictly enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules rely on path-based authorization, where the user ID in the path
 * is compared to the authenticated user's ID. This eliminates the need for
 * additional reads to determine ownership. For example, the userId on the ActivityLog and ProblemSolved records matches the parent userId in the path.
